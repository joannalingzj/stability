# stability

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of stability is to analyse stability data to determine product expiry date based on pre-defined upper/lower limits in the drug development process. Observed stability results and expiry date based on the chosen stability model are visualised by time (months) and batch. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stability from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("joanna-ling/stability")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#### Load Required Packages ####
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

suppressMessages(
  pacman::p_load(
    tidyverse,
    ggplot2,
    readxl,
    janitor,
    stringr,
    ggpubr,
    stability
  )
)

#   4. A tibble of the parameter estimates, standard errors, t value and p-value for each model 
#   5. The estimated expiry date from the chosen model as a number
#   6. The plot of observed stability data and predicted model fit with the appropriate confidence intervals up till the expiry date
#   7. A list of residual plots for models 1 to 4.
